        <h3>Under Construction.  This website will be built as a scheduling service for a music tutor, which is <bold>myself</bold>.  My name is Keith, and I love music. More importantly,
            I love learning and teaching music as an endless pursuit to an endless array of possibilities. I selected this site because it is a project with which I can easily pour a generous amount of passion.<h3>
       
        <p>You can expect the website to allow for fields and input, along with user interfaces and design changes.  Buckle up, because this one's going in the portfolio.</p>
